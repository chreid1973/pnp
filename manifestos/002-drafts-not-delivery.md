# Drafts ≠ Delivery

Version: v1

## Thesis (≤120 words)
A draft is a conversation with yourself. Delivery is a conversation with the world. They are not the same skill, and people hide in the first to avoid doing the second. “Drafts ≠ Delivery” is a reminder that hitting Publish/Push/Print is the actual work — not hoarding revisions in private.

## The Irritation
Creators pile up half-finished posts, branches, Canva files, and mockups, then say “I’ve been working on this for months.” No, you haven’t. You’ve been *circling* it for months. Work that never leaves the nest doesn’t count.

## The Doctrine
- Drafts are allowed to be messy.
- Delivery must be clear, dated, and public.
- We don’t ship to impress; we ship to move the project forward.
- We optimize for audience contact, not personal perfection.
- “It’s not ready” is not a reason after the 5th draft.

## Applied
- WordPress: schedule it, don’t save it forever.
- GitHub: merge the branch and iterate in public.
- Stremio add-ons: ship a basic catalog before the fancy stuff.
- Merch: release the version with the typo, tell people v2 is coming.
- FKNWS: run a recurring “Delivered Today” block.
