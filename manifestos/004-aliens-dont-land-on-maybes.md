# Aliens Don’t Land on Maybes

## Thesis (≤120 words)
People, customers, readers — they’re like ships looking for a landing pad. They do not land on concepts, intentions, or “coming soons.” They land on clear, finished, stable things. “Aliens Don’t Land on Maybes” is our way of saying: build the pad. Make it obvious. Make it ready. The universe rewards completed surfaces.

## The Irritation
We see sites with half-working features, add-ons “coming later,” stores with no payment, blogs with “lorem ipsum,” and then the owner wonders why nobody “shows up.” They didn’t know where to land. You didn’t give them a runway.

## The Doctrine
- Shipping includes making it easy to receive.
- A feature nobody can find is a feature that doesn’t exist.
- “Under construction” is fine for 24 hours, not 24 weeks.
- Document it or it doesn’t exist.
- Surfaces before secrets.

## Applied
- Your P≠P store: cart works, Snipcart works → landing pad.
- FKNWS posts: real links, real feeds → landing pad.
- WordPress features: add a popup telling people about dark mode → landing pad.
- Stremio add-on catalogs: return *something* → landing pad.
- Merch: put the slogan on cotton → landing pad.
