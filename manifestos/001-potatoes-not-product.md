# Potatoes ≠ Product

## Thesis (≤120 words)
Ideas are cheap, delicious, and everywhere. Products are rare, useful, and finished. Confusing the two is how people stay “busy” without ever shipping. “Potatoes ≠ Product” is our line in the sand: we don’t celebrate the mashed-potato version of a thing; we celebrate the tower you can actually land a spaceship on. Meaning is in construction, not imagination.

## The Irritation
We meet too many people who are permanently “working on something” but never release anything. They show sketches, mockups, moodboards, “the direction it’s going,” and then… nothing. Then they want the same recognition as someone who shipped. That’s fraud by vibes.

## The Doctrine
- Raw impulse is not a product.
- Prototypes are a phase, not a lifestyle.
- A product must be usable by someone else.
- We prefer fewer finished things over many eternal drafts.
- We tell the truth about what stage we’re in.

## Applied
- Store copy calls out the mashed-potato phase.
- Shirts use the ≠ symbol to make it visual.
- FKNWS can run “we only post things that actually shipped.”
- Dark/light mode can highlight “built” features (scroll to top, dark mode) to model the idea.
- Future drops can riff: “Drafts ≠ Delivery,” “Mockups ≠ Market.”
