# Mashed Petatoes Fhase (Typo Run)

ID: 003
Version: v1
Approved by: 3 Hole Punch Media

## Thesis (≤120 words)
Some things need to exist before they are perfect. This drop proves it. We shipped the typo on purpose to make the point: real work gets released, imaginary work gets revised forever. “Mashed Petatoes Fhase” is a public declaration that shipping is more important than flawless orthography.

## The Irritation
People are using “I have to fix X” as a socially acceptable way not to publish. They say “later,” and later never arrives. Draft graveyards, Figma purgatory, WordPress Pending Hell. We don’t accept that. Typos are not a good enough reason to hide the work.

## The Doctrine
- We ship if the idea is clear.
- We annotate mistakes instead of burying them.
- We keep funny errors because they become lore.
- Version 1 can be messy; version 2 can be clean.
- Shipping ≠ spelling.

## Applied
- Shirt prints the wrong text: “Mashed Petatoes Fhase.”
- Red editor notes show we *know* it’s wrong.
- Stamp says “Approved by 3 Hole Punch Media” to make it canon.
- Product page explains it’s the “Typo Run.”
- FKNWS gets an article: “Spelling ≠ Shipping.”
